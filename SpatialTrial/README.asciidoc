SpatialTrial
============

A trial of Neo4jSpatial, using BDD (in ScalaTest) to explore the API and write
the least amount of code possible to do something meaningful.

Notes
-----

After some exploratory tests, link:SpatialTrial/src/test/scala/Neo4jSpatialSpec.scala
attempts to create a location annotated node, then find it.

Challenges started with identifying the minimal required dependencies and
repositories. The link:SpatialTrial/project/build/SpatialTrialProject.scala
sbt project file is the result.
