SpatialTrial
============

A trial of Neo4jSpatial, using BDD (in ScalaTest) to explore the API and write
the least amount of code possible to do something meaningful.

Notes
-----

After some exploratory tests, link:SpatialTrial/src/test/scala/Neo4jSpatialSpec.scala[]
attempts to create a location annotated node, then find it.

Challenges started with identifying the minimal required dependencies and
repositories. The link:SpatialTrial/project/build/SpatialTrialProject.scala[]
sbt project file is the result. 

Running
-------

This project is written in scala and uses SBT. With scala and SBT installed,
you can run the tests by executing:

[source,Bash]
----
sbt test
